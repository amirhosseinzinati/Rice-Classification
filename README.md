# Rice-Classification
Rice Classification using MobileNet with 99% Accuracy
This project aims to classify five different types of rice using a pre-trained MobileNet model. The model was fine-tuned on a dataset consisting of thousands of rice images, resulting in an impressive accuracy of 99%. The five rice types include Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag.

The project includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and inference. The code is written in Python, using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. The dataset used for training and testing was from [Rice Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset).

Feel free to clone the repository, try out the model, and contribute to the project. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome!
